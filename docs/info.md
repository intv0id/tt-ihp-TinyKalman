## How it works

This project implements a simplified 1D Kalman Filter (Complementary Filter logic) to fuse Accelerometer and Gyroscope data from an MPU-6500 sensor. It calculates Roll and Pitch angles using a CORDIC algorithm for the accelerometer and integrates gyroscope data with a steady-state Kalman gain. Yaw is calculated by simple integration of the Z-axis gyroscope data.

The system consists of:
*   **SPI Master**: Configures and reads data from the MPU-6500 sensor (100Hz sample rate).
*   **CORDIC Core**: Calculates `atan2` for Roll and Pitch estimation from accelerometer data.
*   **Kalman Filter**: Fuses the accelerometer angle with gyroscope rate.
*   **UART Transmitter**: Outputs the calculated angles (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) as a binary stream at 9600 baud.

Data Format (8 bytes per packet):
1.  Header High: `0xDE`
2.  Header Low: `0xAD`
3.  Roll High
4.  Roll Low
5.  Pitch High
6.  Pitch Low
7.  Yaw High
8.  Yaw Low

## How to test

Connect an MPU-6500 sensor via SPI and a UART receiver (e.g., FTDI cable) to the output.
The default configuration assumes a 10MHz system clock.

Pinout:
*   `uo[0]`: SPI MOSI
*   `uo[1]`: SPI SCLK
*   `uo[2]`: SPI CS_N
*   `ui[0]`: SPI MISO
*   `uo[3]`: UART TX (9600 baud)

For simulation, run `make` in the `test/` directory.

## External hardware

*   MPU-6500 (or MPU-6050/9250) IMU sensor.
*   UART Receiver (USB-Serial adapter).
